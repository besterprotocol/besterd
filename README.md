Bester protocol daemon, yes I know a description could do. Think XMPP but general and modular.

Not related to the devil.

## Usage

Run as follows, where `<configFile>` is the JSON configuration file of your
bester daemon:

````
./besterd <configFile>
````

## Build

Make sure you have `dub` and `dmd` installed, clone the repository and run the following:

````
dub build
````
